# Sentiment Analysis Project Repository
Welcome to the Sentiment Analysis Project! This repository contains the code and resources needed to perform sentiment analysis on text data using Python libraries such as joblib, PorterStemmer, and TfidfVectorizer. This project demonstrates how to preprocess text data, build a machine learning model, and evaluate its performance.
